# Cole Hunter, Web Application Portfolio
## Full Stack Software Developer
Greetings! My name is Cole and Iâ€™m a software developer with a penchant for design and finding creative solutions. In 2020, I graduated from a rigorous software development program, during which I created and contributed to multiple full stack web applications. I have detailed these projects below.
## My Projects
### Cram
A full stack web app for creating and studying flashcards. Users can create flashcards to study, organized by decks. Decks can then be studied, utilizing an interface to reveal the answer when ready. Progress is tracked.
