Hi, I’m Cole and I’m a software developer.
If you’re looking for an enthusiastic web developer, well-rounded in modern technologies, I believe I’m well suited to meet the needs of your team.

## About Me
My technical career began 7 years ago, when I studied my first programming language, C++. That led me to an internship with the Harris County District Clerk’s Office, where I got to observe the day to day work of seasoned programmers. Immediately after that, I found a position with a small web marketing firm, where I worked for 3.5 years. There I learned the basics of web design, search engine optimization, and business etiquette.

About a year ago, I realized it was time to receive some formal education and training in modern software development. That led me to enroll in a coding school called App Academy, a rigorous thousand-hour curriculum that covered the full-stack of software development. While there, I sharpened my coding skills in several technologies, including React/Redux, Javascript, Python and Flask.

## My Projects

### Congestion

A puzzle game based on the Windows game Blocked In, that allows users to create and play puzzles.
Puzzle layouts are read from the database and rendered with React components.
Puzzle layouts are stored in a database table as a string that represents the position and identity of the different moving pieces.
The state of gameplay is managed by two classes, Car and Game, which work to update changes in position and facilitate tasks such as resetting the board.
The Redux store is used to handle sessions, database and UI.
